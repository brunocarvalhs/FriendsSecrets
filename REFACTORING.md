## Dependency Injection with Hilt

We've implemented Hilt for dependency injection to improve the maintainability and testability of the codebase:

- Added Hilt dependencies to the project
- Created Hilt modules for different components:
  - `AppModule`: Provides application-level dependencies
  - `RepositoryModule`: Provides repository implementations
  - `ServiceModule`: Provides service implementations
  - `UseCaseModule`: Provides use case implementations
- Updated the `CustomApplication` class to use Hilt
- Updated ViewModels to use Hilt for dependency injection
- Updated Activities and Fragments to use Hilt for dependency injection

Benefits:
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Improved testability through dependency injection
- Clearer dependency graph
- Easier to maintain and extend

## Architecture Improvements

We've improved the architecture to better follow clean architecture principles:

- Created a more consistent structure for the codebase
- Improved separation of concerns between layers
- Added base classes for common functionality
- Standardized the approach to data handling with `NetworkBoundResource`

Benefits:
- More maintainable codebase
- Easier to understand and extend
- Better separation of concerns
- More consistent code structure

## Coroutine Handling

We've improved the handling of coroutines in the application:

- Added a `CoroutineDispatcherProvider` to centralize dispatcher management
- Created helper methods for launching coroutines in ViewModels
- Standardized error handling in coroutines
- Improved the use of dispatchers for better performance

Benefits:
- More consistent coroutine usage
- Better error handling
- Improved testability of coroutine code
- Better performance through appropriate dispatcher usage

## Error Handling

We've improved error handling throughout the application:

- Created a `ResultWrapper` class for standardized error handling
- Improved error reporting and logging
- Added better error handling in ViewModels
- Standardized error handling in use cases

Benefits:
- More consistent error handling
- Better error reporting for debugging
- Improved user experience with better error messages
- Easier to maintain and extend

## Base Classes

We've created base classes to reduce code duplication and improve consistency:

- `BaseViewModel`: Common functionality for all ViewModels
- `BaseUseCase`: Common functionality for all use cases
- `NetworkBoundResource`: Common functionality for repository implementations

Benefits:
- Reduced code duplication
- More consistent code structure
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Better separation of concerns

## UI Component System

We've created a comprehensive UI component system to improve layout maintainability:

- Created standardized dimensions in `Dimensions.kt`
- Implemented reusable UI components with consistent styling
- Added previews for all components
- Created a screen layout system for consistent UI structure
- Added detailed documentation for the component system

Components created:
- `FriendsButton` and `FriendsOutlinedButton`
- `FriendsTextField` and `FriendsOutlinedTextField`
- `FriendsCard` and `FriendsOutlinedCard`
- `FriendsScreenLayout` for consistent screen structure

Benefits:
- Improved visual consistency across the app
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance of UI components
- Simplified updates to design system
- Better developer productivity

## Testing Improvements

We've improved the testability of the codebase:

- Added dependency injection for easier mocking
- Created base classes with better testability
- Improved separation of concerns for easier testing
- Added better error handling for more robust tests
- Added previews for UI components to visually test them

Benefits:
- Easier to write tests
- More robust tests
- Better test coverage
- Easier to maintain and extend tests
- Visual testing through previews
